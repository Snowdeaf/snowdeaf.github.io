Using Zoia to make an Ebow a polyphonic instrument. Zoia creates the triad with it's quantized scales. Zoia's granular module is used to transpose the notes because the pitch shifter module is totally unusable. Granular module is really slow but slow swells are Ebow's forte anyway so it doesn't matter here. And a reverb and a delay can do miracles.

The footswitches are used to select the root note and the scale by cycling through sequencers. 

There's another video on Instagram where the Synthstrom Deluge was used to create the harmonies. Check it out: https://www.instagram.com/p/CGZppseB40D/
