An effect loosely based on the Boss Slicer.

Program your own patterns with the onboard 16-step sequencer. 

3 modes of operation:
1) GATE for fast attack and release
2) CV for smoother operation
3) RAMP for linear curves

Or a combination of RAMP and GATE or CV.

Internal clock or MIDI clock with multiplier.

Trigger sensitivity for fine-tuning accurate triggering on incoming audio.
