Stresslessness - Live looping with Moog Mavis &amp; Synthstrom Deluge 

A mellow Sunday ambientish live looping jam with the wonderful Moog Mavis and ever-excellent Synthstrom Deluge with 1010music Bluebox providing some cloudy reverberation. 

Moog Mavis is controlled by CV and hand.

Recorded live with no overdubs. Well, other than what's shown on the video!
