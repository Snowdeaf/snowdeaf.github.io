Untangling Plaits - looping a single pattern on Lúbadh using Eloquencer to create more complex harmonies and melodies. 

Plaits provides the pianoesque sound and PICO DSP some nice reverb. 
Using the AUX output of Cosmix send the sequence to Lúbadh.

There may have been some additional reverb on the 1010Music BlueBox while recording.

Lúbadh is such a versatile module and I am slowly getting grips on it.
