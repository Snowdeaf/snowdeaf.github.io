A cover of Helmet’s (https://youtu.be/jBfygUiS50g) In The Meantime done entirely on the Arturia Minibrute 2S.  Or seven of them. (Actually nine tracks but who's counting).

A bit of Erica Synths PicoDSP reverb on the snare and some tiny tiny eq tweaks in GarageBand.

Minibrute 2S is a wonderful analogue synth with a very capable sequencer - totally underutilized here. Just some pattern chaining to sequence the song.
