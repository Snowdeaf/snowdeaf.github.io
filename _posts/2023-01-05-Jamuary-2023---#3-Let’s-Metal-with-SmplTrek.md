Can SmplTrek handle metal? It sure can!

A Gibson Les Paul Custom recorded straight into SmplTrek using device’s Metal Amp insert fx. No other equipment used.

Bass is the default bass sample that comes with the device.
Drums loops are free loops from somewhere on the www, don't remember where.

Song was “mixed” on the device. Recorded straight into Logic. No plugins used.

SmplTrek is a great little box for “quick” demoing.
