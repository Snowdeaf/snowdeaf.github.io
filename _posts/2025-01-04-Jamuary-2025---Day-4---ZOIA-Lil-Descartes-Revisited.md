Revisting my old ZOIA patch, LIL DESCARTES - a sequencer (very loosely) based on Make Noise René Eurorack module. 

I added a couple of oscillators for the jam now that there is more CPU available on the 5.0 firmware for ZOIA. I didn’t update the patch on Patchstorage, though. So everything on the second page seen on the video, is NOT on the original patch, which can be downloaded from: https://patchstorage.com/lil-descartes/  Bleep bleep!
