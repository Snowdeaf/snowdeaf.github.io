This is a user requested video to show you how to connect Synthstrom Deluge to Moog Mavis. 
There are two simple methods depending on where you want to output Mavis.

1) Use Deluge to control Mavis via CV and output Mavis to a mixer or headphones or wherever.
2) Use Deluge to control Mavis via CV and output Mavis back to an audio track on Deluge for easy recording and overdubbing.
