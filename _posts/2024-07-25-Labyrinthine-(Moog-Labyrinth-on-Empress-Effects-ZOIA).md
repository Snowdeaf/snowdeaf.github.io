“No Moog Labyrinth? No Problem! Use ZOIA Instead”

A patch based on the Moog Labyrinth.

Moog Labyrinth is a “parallel generative analog synthesizer” with an interesting take on random sequencing. I just wanted to see if I could make the same on the ZOIA - without the analog part of course.

Not ALL the functions of the Moog have been implemented due to the CPU limitations of both ZOIA and yours truly. Labyrinth is an analog synth with a wavefolder. ZOIA doesn’t have a wavefolder so the duty cycles of oscillators have been used to mimic that behaviour. 

Some sequencing functions like chaining and buffer saving have been left out due to CPU limitations as well. Although the “buffer”  can be saved by resaving the patch.

The LFO capabilities of VCO 2 have also been omitted. 

But the gist of the Labyrinth sequencer has been implemented.
