A generative patch using Cre8audio’s West Pest and Moog Mavis.

West Pest has a random note pattern generator which is quite erratic but fun anyways. It’d be great if it could be quantized to a scale. Of course there are Eurorack modules for that but still.

Recorded on a 1010music Bluebox with some delay added.
