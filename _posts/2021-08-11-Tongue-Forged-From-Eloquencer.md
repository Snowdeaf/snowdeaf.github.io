Another jam with the Winter Modular Eloquencer. Still learning. Still jamming. Still liking it. 

IO Instruments Himalia loaded with my own (well, Nine Inch Nails) samples.

Other sound sources: Make Noise Telharmonic and Mutable Instruments Plaits 
Effects: Erica Synths Pico DSP reverb and Noise Engineering Desmodus Versio with the Electus firmware. 

Roland Bitrazer modified with the Aira Modual Customizer to work as a VCA with the Tube Clip overdrive. Excellent module, too bad Roland stopped supporting them. 

Bonus points for everyone who gets the title reference!
