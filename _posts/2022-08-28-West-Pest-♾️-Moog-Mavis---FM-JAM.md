A quick FM jam with Cre8audio West Pest and Moog Mavis.

Sequenced by West Pest, clocked by Moog Mavis’ LFO. Mavis' SAW oscillator into the FM of West Pest.

West Pest MULTI (as clocked LFO) into FOLD MOD, totally unnecessarily patched thru Mavis’ mixer here. Also, Mavis’ KB CV into West Pest’s PITCH unused in this video.

West Pest LFO OUT (triangle) into Mavis’ filter CUTOFF attenuated but Moog Mavis’ ATTN.

Recorded straight into 1010 Music Bluebox, with loads of delay added there.
