An Empress Effects ZOIA sequencer patch to control the IO Instruments Himalia Penta Sound Source module.

Himalia's RED channel has 16 different CV selectable samples. The sample selection responds to 1V/oct CV but the step between samples differs. However, it's easy to create a ZOIA patch where this can be taken into account. 

This ZOIA patch can obviously be used control any other module as well. 
I just wanted to make a little patch to make quick drum patterns with Himalia.
